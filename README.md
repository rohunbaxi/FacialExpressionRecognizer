# FacialExpressionRecognizer
 Python app (built with Keras, Numpy, and deployed in Flask) that recognizes facial expressions from a webcam or video using a trained neural network

To use, pip install all the dependencies from requirements.txt and run main.py
The neural network is trained on almost 40 000 images, and has an accuracy of about 84%. 
Upload a video of your choice or turn on your webcam. 
The algorithm tracks each frame individually and monitors changes in facial expression and updates the video live with a bounding box across the recognized face
and the best available mood.
